=======
YARPLER stands for Yet Another Resource Planing Language and is a toolchain to parse and solve optimization problems. YARPLER offers a dynamic workflow that can be expanded by developers to solve any type of problems.

This version uses the MiniZinc distribution and translates the YARPL files to be solved by FlatZinc.
